"""Earned-Lapis tuning: the game's Lapis income was balanced around buying Lapis, which this server can't.

Three knobs, all for Lapis you EARN by playing (Shop purchases are never touched):

  EXVIUS_LAPIS_MULTIPLIER (default 1.5)   every earned Lapis amount is multiplied: mission challenges, event
                                          repeats, rank-ups, login and catch-up mails, quests, raids, arena...
  EXVIUS_DAILY_QUEST_LAPIS (default 150)  every daily quest pays this much Lapis (the original server's
                                          daily rewards were never preserved; the ones here were authored)
  EXVIUS_DAILY_ALL_BONUS (default 200)    extra Lapis for finishing all of a day's daily quests
  EXVIUS_WEEKLY_GIFT (default "23:50:10,23:70:1")
                                          mailed once per summon-rotation week: 10 Rare Summon Tickets and a
                                          Guaranteed Ticket (4★/5★/NV), a 10+1's worth to use with any banner's
                                          Ticket Summon button. "" turns it off.

Set the multiplier to 1, the daily values to 0 and the gift to "" to get the stock economy back. The multiplier
and daily amounts are applied before the daily bonus is multiplied, so with the defaults a full day of
dailies pays (3 x 150 + 200) x 1.5 = 975 Lapis.
